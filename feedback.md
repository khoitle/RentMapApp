# Project 3 Feedback

## Back-end Technology

>**Progressing:** Lacking more than one model

## Front-end Technology

>**Performing:** Front-end makes appropriate use of Angular controllers and states with ui-router.

## Code Quality

>**Progressing:** Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc)

## Deployment and Functionality

>**Excelling:** App has advanced functionality that works with minimal errors, and may make use of advanced tools such as APIs, plugins, etc. App may be deployed to a service other than Heroku (e.g. Digital Ocean).


## Planning / Process / Submission

>**Progressing:** App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application

Overall, you guys built an awesome app and should be very proud of the work you did!
I hope you continue to build on this, and work together to implement the rest of your desired features.
